## TODO

* Maybe make OutputActionData purge check when removing ActionSet or ActionLayer from profile
* ~~Integrate HandyControl controls to UI. Not actively used but linking NuGet package~~
* Possibly integration Font Awesome into project
* ~~Decide on locking mechanism for main mapper routine. Needed for external
routines to not interfere (loading profiles primarily)~~
* ~~Possibly change TriggerDualStageAction to take hard trigger button
click into account rather than use intepolated range for Full Pull activation.
Might open some options for the Soft Pull range~~
* ~~Allow full range Outer Ring binding for TouchpadActionPad.
Allows center dead zone button~~
* Possibly look into outer starting dead zone for TouchpadMouse and
TouchpadActionPad. Can sometimes be easy to touch the Touchpad when
aiming for the face buttons
* ~~Migrate some changes back to switchpromappertest project~~
* ~~Implement Touchpad Directional Swipe action type~~
* ~~Figure out how to emulate force feedback support for haptics~~

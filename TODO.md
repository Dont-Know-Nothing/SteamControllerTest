## TODO

* ~~Migrate some changes back to switchpromappertest project~~
* Implement Touchpad Directional Swipe action type
* Possibly look into outer starting dead zone for TouchpadMouse and
TouchpadActionPad. Can sometimes be easy to touch the Touchpad when
aiming for the face buttons
* ~~Figure out how to emulate force feedback support for haptics~~
